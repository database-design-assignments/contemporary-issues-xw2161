# Covid vaccine passports
I discuss two articles about Covid vaccine passports. Users can upload their vaccination records or Covid test results into the vaccine passport app, and the app will generate a unique digital health certificate in the form of a QR code. There are many players in the field right now, including IBM, the Commons Project, and the Covid Credentials Initiative, chasing the same goal: let people share required information about their health, while protecting other private information. Vaccine passports could allow people to easily present their health information on their smartphones in an encrypted yet verifiable way but there are challenges and ethical concerns.

## Article 1
In New Tork Times' [Coming Soon: The Vaccine Passport](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/travel/coronavirus-vaccine-passports.html) predicts that, in the near future, vaccine passports will play an important role in travel. Digital documentation may be required to show that passengers have been vaccinated or tested for the coronavirus. Governments and companies in the travel industry are promoting vaccine passports. 

One of President Biden’s executive orders aimed at curbing the pandemic asks government agencies to “assess the feasibility” of linking coronavirus vaccine certificates with other vaccination documents, and producing digital versions. Denmark’s government suggested that it will roll out a digital passport that will allow citizens to show they have been vaccinated. 

Zurab Pololikashvili, secretary general of the United Nations World Tourism Organization, suggested that vaccine passports could be essential to restarting the tourism industry. Etihad Airways and Emirates will start using a digital travel pass to help passengers manage their travel plans and provide airlines and governments documentation that they have been vaccinated or tested for Covid-19.

## Article 2
MIT Technology Review's [Will you have to carry a vaccine passport on your phone?](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/21/1015353/covid-vaccine-passport-digital-immunity-record/), points out the underlying problems. Building a vaccine passport app presents technical challenges and brings up serious ethical and legal considerations for blocking people from ordinary activities on the basis of their vaccination status. 

First, immunization doesn’t mean safety. Vaccines appear highly effective at preventing symptoms of covid-19, but they may not stop  people from catching and spreading the virus asymptomatically. As a result, a vaccine passport is a proof of inoculation, not immunity from ever catching or spreading the disease. Plus no one knows how long the immunity provided by the vaccines will last. 

Second, linking up systems is very difficult, especially in the US. Universal vaccine credentials may be close to impossible in the US, where patient data is fragmented across tens of thousands of health-care businesses. In addition, connecting any systems across borders means navigating a patchwork of languages, databases, and privacy laws.

Third, no one solution will work for everybody. Screening people by vaccination status is hard when no country has made vaccination mandatory so far. There are cases in which people who might otherwise be eligible, for example, pregnant women or those who suffer from serious allergies, are discouraged from receiving the vaccine. There are also concerns that the vaccine passport technology may not be accessible enough to certain populations, such as the elderly and the homeless.
